# Challenge_Alkemy
Challenge from Alkemy's academy
Well guys, this is just a program which takes three csv files from a specific website, for that job I used Regex and webscrapping, looking for the specific files in the given website.
the files must be named as the downloaded date and it has to be stored in a specific directory.
After that we'd must to create three DDBB in postgress sql which contains different information. we had to implement SQLAlchemy for the job. 
So basically with all the downloaded information the program have to fill the BBDD and update it.
